            At mykeychains.in, we take your personal privacy very seriously. Protecting your online privacy is
            important to us, not just from a business perspective, but from an ethical one as well. We therefore are
            proud to share with you our honest, open and 100% understandable privacy and security policy. We do not sell
            our database of information about you. That is NOT our revenue model. <br><br>

            We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your
            explicit consent and we only use your information as described in the Privacy Policy. We view protection of
            your privacy as a very important community principle. We understand clearly that you and Your Information is
            one of our most important assets. We store and process your personal Information on our servers which are
            protected by physical as well as technological security devices.<br><br>

            We collect "personal" information from you when you provide it to us. For example, if you purchase a product
            from us, we may collect your name, mailing address, telephone number and email address. If you sign up to
            receive a newsletter, we will collect your email address. If you take advantage of special services offered
            by us, we may collect other personal information about you. We use your personal information for internal
            purposes such as processing and keeping you informed of your order. <br><br>

            Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your Personal Information that we have collected with any
            other company for their marketing purposes without your consent. We reserve the right to communicate your
            personal information to any third party that makes a legally-compliant request for its disclosure.
            Otherwise, however, we will not disclose your name, address and other information which identifies you
            personally to any third party without your consent. We reserve the right to collect general demographic and
            other anonymous information that does not personally identify you. This information is not associated with
            your personally identifiable information and cannot be linked to you personally.</p>
